# Sudoku Solver

In this Python project, I created a Sudoku solver equipped with a GUI, utilizing a backtracking method. 
The GUI solver not only shows the solving process for any given Sudoku puzzle but also provides a fully playable interface resembling a traditional Sudoku game.

## Description

For the GUI version of the game, select a cell and input numbers 1-9 on the keybard.
By pressing 0 the cell will be reset. Buttons for solving, quitting or resetting the game
can be pressed at any time.

### Libraries

Pygame is needed for the GUI version of the game.

Install pygame with:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Executing program

Run the sudoku_solver.py for the text based version and sudoku_gui.py for an interactive user interface.
